### **5. In Vercel - Change Build Command**

Go to Vercel → Settings → Build and Deployment

**Change Build Command to:**
```
bash build.sh
```

**Output Directory:**
```
dist
```

**Save & Redeploy**

---

## 🎯 **WHY THIS WORKS:**

Instead of using `npm run build` (which has permission issues), we're using a **bash script** that Vercel CAN execute!
```
Vercel runs: bash build.sh
↓
build.sh runs: npm install + npx vite build
↓
Creates dist/ folder
↓
SUCCESS! 🎉
